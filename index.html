            <h2>Why Melbourne?</h2>
            <h3>Melbourne, the most livable city in the world!</h3>
            <p>
              Melbourne achieved a perfect score of 100/100 for education,
              healthcare and infrastructure, along with impressive ratings for
              culture and environment (95.8/100) and stability (95/100). Yet, it
              is not just our exceptional lifestyle that sets Melbourne apart;
              it's also the genuine warmth of our local residents.
            </p>
            <p>
              Melbourne is more affordable than many other cities like Hong
              Kong, Singapore and Sydney. From kindergarten through to
              university, Melbourne is home to some of the region’s best
              educational institutions. Melburnians have a life expectancy that
              is amongst the highest in the world, buoyed by Australia’s
              world-renowned healthcare system, which includes high quality
              public and private hospitals, as well as community health
              services, ambulance and dental services.

                <h4>Café Higher Ground</h4>
                <p>
                  Housed in a heritage-listed powerhouse, Higher Ground is an
                  all-day dining destination located in the heart of Melbourne’s
                  CBD. Six connected levels wrap around the perimeter of the
                  original brick building to create a suite of intimate tiered
                  platforms. An evocative, inventive, and highly curated menu
                  offers guests the very best that Melbourne has to offer.

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Higher Ground is an all-day dining destination welcoming
                  guests from morning through to late afternoon and offers a
                  unique and refined blend of a café and restaurant. The dining
                  room ceilings are 15 metres high and the space floods with
                  natural light during the day. The upstairs level, which comes
                  with its own barista station, is an unhurried lounge to read,
                  work or eat a meal in.

                <p>
                  Brunch shouldn't just be an affair for the morning, and thanks
                  to the likes of Emil's Café, it doesn't have to be. Once their
                  childhood home, brothers John and George El-Khoury have
                  refurbished their family's corner milk bar into Emil's Café, a
                  licensed all-day brunch spot with a nostalgic, homely feel.
                  Chef Sam Pinzone sits at the helm of the kitchen, serving up
                  an Australian-Arabic menu alongside Code Black Coffee and a
                  selection of cocktails, juices and smoothies.

                  with slow-cooked beef ribs and tahini hollandaise, and knafeh
                  spun pastry with pistachio crumb and rose syrup. The 80-seat
                  space is laden with natural light and features a fireplace and
                  brickwork to make you feel right at home.

                <p>
                  First Love Coffee is a specialty venture by the founders of
                  artisanal bakery Rustica. It's a slick coffee bar at the base
                  of Collins Arch that pours locally roasted blends you can pair
                  with flaky Rustica pastries and grab-and-go salads and sangas.
                  Floor-to-ceiling windows allow you to take in the busy
                  streetscape, if you can draw your gaze from the cafe's
                  interior, that is.

                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  While Rustica is best known for its sourdoughs and pastries,
                  First Love makes locally-roasted coffee the star. All white
                  coffees are made with Polaroid Espresso, a Brazilian,
                  Colombian and Ethiopian specialty blend that has notes of
                  strawberry and maple syrup and a light floral finish. You can
                  also choose from a variety of single-origin roasts. All the
                  beans for First Love blends are sourced green and roasted at
                  Port Melbourne's Criteria Coffee.
